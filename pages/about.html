                “...those of us who work in civic tech want public digital goods to be as good as the ones made by
                commercial entities like Apple or Google—and we want public digital infrastructure to be as good, too.”

            <h2>Who is Code for America?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Code for America is a non-partisan, non-political 501 organization founded in 2009 to address the
                widening gap between the public and private sectors in their effective use of technology and design.
                Part of what they do is lead the Code for America Brigade Network where over 25,000 active members are
                committed to making their local communities better. Leveraging on the Code for America name and the
                tools they provide improve the way in which we work.

            <h2>Why join us?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Code for Chicago operates like a pro-bono digital consultancy. In lieu of making decisions on behalf of
                the communities we serve, we operate shoulder-to-shoulder. When we start a new project we typically
                partner up with a local organization. This means we begin by identifying their needs, drafting a problem
                statement, and collaborating throughout the process. Since we aren't our users, this ensures we are
                effectively addressing the needs of the community and not operating from our own perspective as
                practitioners.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Other than doing projects for a good cause, volunteers of various skill sets and levels join us to try
                out civic tech, network with like-minded people, and learn new skills.
