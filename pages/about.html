        “...those of us who work in civic tech want public digital goods to be
        as good as the ones made by commercial entities like Apple or Google—and
        we want public digital infrastructure to be as good, too.”

      <h2>Who is Code for America?</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Code for America is a non-partisan, non-political 501 organization
        founded in 2009 to address the widening gap between the public and
        private sectors in their effective use of technology and design. Part of
        what they do is lead the Code for America Brigade Network where over
        25,000 active members are committed to making their local communities
        better. Leveraging on the Code for America name and the tools they
        provide improve the way in which we work.

      <h2>Why join us?</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Code for Chicago operates like a pro-bono digital consultancy. In lieu
        of making decisions on behalf of the communities we serve, we operate
        shoulder-to-shoulder. When we start a new project we typically partner
        up with a local organization. This means we begin by identifying their
        needs, drafting a problem statement, and collaborating throughout the
        process. Since we aren't our users, this ensures we are effectively
        addressing the needs of the community and not operating from our own
        perspective as practitioners.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Other than doing projects for a good cause, volunteers of various skill
        sets and levels join us to try out civic tech, network with like-minded
        people, and learn new skills.
