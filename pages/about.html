            <h2>What is Civic Tech?</h2>
            <p>
                Civic tech bridges the gap between the civic space and technology. It’s utilizing technology practices
                like design,
                engineering, data science, etc. to optimize the processes for civic organizations.

            <h2>Who is Code for America?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Code for America is a non-partisan, non-political 501 organization founded in 2009 to address the
                widening gap between the public and private sectors in their effective use of technology and design.
                Part of what they do is lead the Code for America Brigade Network where over 25,000 active members
                are
                committed to making their local communities better. Leveraging on the Code for America name and the
                tools they provide improve the way in which we work.

            <p class="text">
                Code for Chicago operates like a pro-bono digital consultancy. In lieu of making decisions on
                behalf of the communities we serve, we operate shoulder-to-shoulder. When we start a new project we
                typically partner up with a local organization. This means we begin by identifying their needs,
                drafting a problem statement, and collaborating throughout the process. Since we aren't our users, this
                ensures we are effectively addressing the needs of the community and not operating from our own
                perspective as practitioners.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Other than doing projects for a good cause, volunteers of various skill sets and levels join us
                to try
                out civic tech, network with like-minded people, and learn new skills.
