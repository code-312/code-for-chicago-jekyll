**Recruitment Status:** Actively recruiting

**Problem Statement:** Currently, C2ST’s website doesn’t capture their goal of “modernizing” their organization on the surface. Additionally, their staff seem to have a difficult time managing their web assets. Solving this problem ensures that their brand fits with their mission, and optimizes their staff operations.

**Deliverable:** [Website](https://www.c2st.org/)

**Current Needs:** Front-end

**Tech:** Wix, Figma

**This would be a good fit for:** There will likely not be a lot of custom code built since this is primarily a Wix/Wordpress project. Hence, it's great if you're interested in web development and getting experience working in a cross-functional team. 

**Meeting Cadence:** Tuesdays at 5:30-6pm
