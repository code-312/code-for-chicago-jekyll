**Problem Statement:** Managing our brigade requires a lot of manual tasks. Our goal is to automate some of the processes to ensure we keep our projects organized and leverage our data to improve our operations as a volunteer organization.

**Deliverable:** An internal product that the Brigade can use to collect surface level data about our volunteers to help us make decisions to keep our brigade operations sustainable.

**Current Needs:** Front-end, back-end, Service Design, UX Research, UX Design, and UI/Visual Design.

**Tech:** React, Node / Express, PostgreSQL

**This would be a good fit for:** This is not necessarily a beginner project. Junior-level folks would need make additional time to learn more about the tech. With that said, everyone is welcome but we recommend taking a look at the repo beforehand.

**Meeting Cadence:** Every other Wednesday at 5:30-6pm CT
