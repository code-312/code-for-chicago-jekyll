In west Philadelphia born and raised\
On the playground was where I spent most of my days\
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool\
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school\
When a couple of guys who were up to no good\
Started making trouble in my neighborhood\
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared\
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
