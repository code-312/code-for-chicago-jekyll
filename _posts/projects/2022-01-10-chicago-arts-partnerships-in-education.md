**Recruitment Status:** Actively recruiting

**Problem Statement:** Currently, CAPE communicates new program offerings via online and in-person. The former manifests in social media posts. The latter includes flyer distribution and physical on-campus presence. Their current style guide doesn’t address these use cases. 
Additionally, the team doesn’t feel like the current CAPE (the organization) brand focus are donors and not necessarily the students.

**Deliverable:** Brande Guide

**Current Needs:** Visual design skills

**Tech:** Figma, Canva

**This would be a good fit for:** Folks interested in visual design. We will not be doing any UI for this project.

**Meeting Cadence:** Bi-monthly meetings on Thursdays at 5:30-6pm CT. Optional bi-monthly meettings with the stakeholder at 4:15-4:45pm CT.
