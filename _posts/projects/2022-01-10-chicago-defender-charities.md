**Recruitment Status:** Actively recruiting

**Problem Statement:** Currently, users can find out about Chicago Defender Charities through the Chicago Defender (their online publication), Mightycause, the Bud Billiken Parade, Bronzeville Life, and Facebook. While these websites and platforms communicate a portion of what they do, they fail to express their full breadth of services and mission to the community.

**Deliverable:** Website, brand guide

**Current Needs:** Front-end, UX/UI/Visual Design, Content Strategy

**Tech:** Squarespace, HTML/CSS

**This would be a good fit for:** For developers, you won't be coding much at this stage. We're primarily working in Squarespace so this project holds more altruistic merit than technical.

For designers, we're still plugging away at the designs and we definitely do need people to help us get to the finish line.

**Meeting Cadence:** Every other Wednesday at 5:30-6pm CT (Developers), and 6-6:30pm CT (Designers). Optional stakeholder meetings every other Friday at 4:30-5pm CT.
