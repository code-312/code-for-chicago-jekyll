**Recruitment Status:** Not actively recruiting

**Problem Statement:** We get a lot of questions about the brigade and we leverage the website to reduce the amount of communication we need to do on a daily basis. We want our potential partners and volunteers to feel they have a grasp of who we are and what we do through our content.

Additionally, we want to ensure our website is sustainable for future volunteers so we're building a design system. The design system may be leveraged for future brigades within the Code for America network since we have similar use cases.

**Deliverable:** [Website](https://codeforchicago.org/)

**Current Needs:** Front-end, UX/UI Design

**Tech:** HTML/CSS, Jekyll, Figma

**This would be a good fit for:** This is a great beginner project for folks interesting in building code and designing components.

**Meeting Cadence:** Every other Monday at 7-7:30pm CT
