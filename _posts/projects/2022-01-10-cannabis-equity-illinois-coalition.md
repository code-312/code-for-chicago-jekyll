**Recruitment Status:** Activiely recruiting developers only

**Problem Statement:** CEIC doesnâ€™t have a defined brand identity or a technical infrastructure to support it as they scale their services and scope. As they onboard volunteers and other staff, they are making new decisions on content and assets. As a result, there may be a misalignment of messages and increased burden of decision making they have to make every single time.

**Deliverable:** [Website](https://cannabisequityil.org/)

**Tech:** Docker Wordpress Container, PHP, HTML/CSS, Figma

**This would be a good fit for:** New folks are welcome on this project!
