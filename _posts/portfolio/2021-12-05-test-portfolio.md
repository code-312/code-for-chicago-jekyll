**Client:** Parks District of Oak Park (PDOP) - a little blurb about them here

**The Challenge:** Recommend a solution that best fit a number of PDOP’s use cases such as: quantitative data, customizable, able to integrate with their servers and fixed pricing.

**Approach:** Code for Chicago facilitated a competitive analysis to identify a solution; by doing this they built a baseline understanding of what products were available in the space, the key differences between each and evaluate PDOP’s use cases.  

**Project Month/Year:** May 2021 

**Problem Statement**

In the past, PDOP used a geofencing solution to quantify the number of people that came to the park. This data could help PDOP make better decisions on how to allocate public resources and understand if they are serving a diverse community at an equity level. 
Currently, they have no methods for collecting data and their decision-making is based on assumptions.

**Our approach**
Based on the array of people counting technologies in the marketplace. The team used a variety of methods and tools to narrow down viable solutions. 
Many of these could be grouped into categories based on either the technology used, like thermal counters, or based on the approach, like using social media. Therefore, the team started with a “divide and conquer” style to reduce masses of possible avenues to practical and effective chunks.

**Solution categories include:**
- Electronic Boards
- Bluetooth & Wifi
- Camera
- Light
- LiDAR
- Passive infrared
- Active infrared
- Radar
- Thermal

**Methodology**

In order to gather valuable information, each solution should identify clear pricing figures, installation guidelines, data collection details, and its strengths and pain points. In addition, a major factor in the analysis was installation and adapting it to each park within Oak park.
Constraints such as size, layout, telecommunication infrastructure and device mobility were identified.

Based on this the team created a number of artifacts to evaluate which people-counters would identify the best fit:
First was a decision tree then a detailed table determining power/wifi connectivity, from there a graph determining the trade-offs for each counter, a chart measuring the accuracy and cost for each solution and lastly a workflow examination after talking to vendors.
Once all the data was collected - scalability and pricing was last compared.

**Outcome**
By completing this project for PDOP, Code for Chicago was able to confidently recommended the ready-made product of a geofencing solution to quantify the number of people that came to the park. This product was recommended because it was:
Built for the outdoors
Listed at a fixed price rate
Relatively accurate at 80-90%
Not dependent on an internet connection to work
Utilized by other large park and recreation departments
