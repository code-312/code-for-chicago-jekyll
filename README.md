## Prerequisites

### node & npm

**Note:** This project is not currently compatible with node v15.0.0 and above.

To verify you have node installed:

```
> node -v
v10.15.2
```

To verify you have npm installed:

```
> npm -v
6.10.0
```

If they or not installed, or your version looks much older than this, proceed to [instructions for installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### ruby

It is advisable to avoid using the OS install of Ruby that comes bundled with MacOS, Ubuntu, and others. Instead we'd suggest using a Ruby virtual environment like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation).

To verify your ruby version:

```
> ruby -v
ruby 2.5.5p157 (2019-03-15 revision 67260) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
```

You should have at least ruby 2.1.0.

### bundler

To install bundler, use:

```
> gem install bundler
```

All contributions are very welcome. ([see this guide](from-trello-to-merge.md))Thank you!
